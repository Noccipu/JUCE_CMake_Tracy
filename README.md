## Project Status

This template was initially developed for a personal project requiring detailed and real time analysis around a plugin developed with the JUCE framework for Windows. I thought it would be useful to share it with other users in the community who have the same profiling and optimization needs.

Any suggestions for approaches, tools or code are welcome, and I'd be delighted to make changes in the future!
